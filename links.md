* [60 Linux Commands you NEED to know (in 10 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd7BXuUQ91w) --- I find this video is really helping me understanding the basic linux commands, since I'm using Windows and the terminal commands are quite different.

* [Basic vi Commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html) --- I recommend this site because it is concise, compact, and clear. This site is also user-friendly for beginners to master the essential vi editor commands. I think that you can make a "cheat sheet" from this site.  

* [Five Things Linux Does Better Than Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4OaB3kSiMI) --- A nice-to-know video that helps me understand why we are doing linux in Operating Systems course. I know that linux might be the best OS for programming, but personally I don't recommend it for daily use.

* [Linux Crash Course - awk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPEnvuj9QrI) --- At first, I thought that "awk" sounds awkward. However, it's actually a powerful text-processing command and very useful for data extraction and reporting.

* [Regular Expression Cheat Sheet](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/v2/security-service/manage-false-positives/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet) --- How can you use awk without knowing regex? I find that reading documentation like this instead of watching YouTube videos is more effective when learning practical concepts like this.

* [5 Key Differences Between GPG and SSH Keys - localhost](https://locall.host/gpg-vs-ssh-key/) --- This site REALLY helps me to understand the difference between GPG and SSH keys. Even though both of them are powerful, but they differ from the use case. If you want to secure authentication to remote servers, then SSH keys are the way to go. However, if you require encryption and signing capabilities for emails or files, then GPG keys would be a better fit.

* [Sudo VS Su: Which is best for Linux?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjQXPnQyOsw) --- This video is helping me to understand the differences between su and sudo. Now I can use su, su -, and sudo depending on the usecase.

* [Linux Directories Explained in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4) --- This video gives me a good understanding of the purpose of the most common Linux directories in just 100 seconds. It turns out that Linux directory isn't too different from Windows directory. Now I can fully understand how my own virtual machine directory works for this entire Operating Systems course.
